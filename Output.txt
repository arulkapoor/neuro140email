Hi AZ

Hope you are doing well! Hope things are not too crazy with the SVB
situation. One of the Prod teams, Etched AI, has been getting a bunch of
inbound interest. They haven't started formally fundraising yet but would
be happy to connect you if you'd like. (Blurb below)

Gavin Uberti and Chris Zhu are working on Etched AI. They're building an
ASIC-based solution that can speed up the performance of Large Language
Models by more than 100x. They have a strong technical design and are
getting ready to bring it to production.

Let me know either way!

Best,
Arul

Hi G,

I hope all is well! Prod partners with First Republic Bank, which is a
world-class private bank that provides financial solutions without fees and
a dedicated group of bankers to each client. Robert Hughes
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberthughes-3/>, copied here, is the Senior
Director of Startup and VC banking at First Republic. He launched the
business for the bank 5 years ago and is an LP on several funds as well as
an Angel investor in a number of startups.

Roberts views early-stage banking as a long-term relationship in which
founders can leverage FRB=E2=80=99s resources.

I will leave it to you two to take it from here and connect about opening a
business banking account.

Best,
Arul

Thanks for the intro Wes (to bcc)!

Great to meet you Anesu, and apologies for the delayed response! Also glad
to hear you already met Ben! Would love to chat in the next few days if
you're game - do you have time sunday afternoon/evening?

Best,
Arul

Hello!

Hanseul, Ethan
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-thornton-74417024a/?trk=3Dorg-employees>=
 is
an MIT dropout working on a super cool defense tech startup who we've been
working with through Prod (blurb below):

*Mach Industries is developing the future of ammunition with a team of a
Thiel Fellow, 8 MIT engineers, and a Green Beret with 2 decades of
experience navigating rapid procurement in the military. Mach=E2=80=99s pro=
jectiles
can travel significantly farther and faster than traditional ammunition,
but at the same cost (eventually even less expensive with economies of
scale). That strategic combination is necessary to combat the rising
threats with asymmetric costs, such as shooting down drone swarms, spy
balloons, and dumb rockets without wasting $1M per shot on a sophisticated
missile.*

For Ethan, Hanseul <https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanseulnam/> is an investor
at Spark and is a close friend/mentor. She's super smart and is a top tier
human, so figured y'all would benefit from chatting.

Hope you find time to speak!

Best,
Arul

Hi all,

Hope you are doing well! Wanted to introduce you to Ethan
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-thornton-74417024a/?trk=3Dorg-employees>
who is a recent MIT freshman dropout and Thiel Fellow. He's working on an
exciting defense startup called Mach Industries (blurb below) and figured
someone on the team may be interested in meeting him.

Hello!

For Nabeel, Gavin and Chris are Harvard students in Prod working on
speeding up LLM performance through ASICs and have had some exciting
technical progress. They=E2=80=99ve gotten a couple of term sheets and are =
thinking
of opening up their round.

For Gavin and Chris, Nabeel is a GP at Spark and has an insane investing
track record. Nabeel has been super helpful in supporting Prod this year
and figured you all would benefit from meeting.

Hope you find time to connect!

Hi Santo,

Apologies for the delay in response - was finishing up final exams. I
really enjoyed meeting Nabeel and talking about what Prod could look like
in the longer term. I am excited to meet more of the team! I will
coordinate with Heather to find time with Alex, Natalie, and Kevin. Thanks
so much!

Best,
Arul

Thanks so much for the intro Hanseul (to bcc).

Nice to meet you Santo! Would love to meet sometime this week / early next

Hi Ed,

I hope all is well! Prod partners with First Republic Bank, which is a
world-class private bank that provides financial solutions without fees and
a dedicated group of bankers to each client. Robert Hughes
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberthughes-3/>, copied here, is the Senior
Director of Startup and VC banking at First Republic. He launched the
business for the bank 5 years ago and is an LP on several funds as well as
an Angel investor in a number of startups.

Roberts views early-stage banking as a long-term relationship in which
founders can leverage FRB=E2=80=99s resources.

I will leave it to you two to take it from here and connect about opening a
business banking account.

Best,
Arul

Hi Michelle,

Hi Claire and Adina,

Connecting you with Ethan (MIT recent drop out + Thiel Fellow). Ethan=E2=80=
=99s
also in SF right now so could potentially meet with someone on the team if
they are available. Below is a short blurb on what he=E2=80=99s been up to.=
 Hope
you find time to connect!

Best,
Arul

*Mach Industries is developing the future of ammunition with a team of a
Thiel Fellow, 8 MIT engineers, and a Green Beret with 2 decades of
experience navigating rapid procurement in the military. Mach=E2=80=99s pro=
jectiles
can travel significantly farther and faster than traditional ammunition,
but at the same cost (eventually even less expensive with economies of
scale). That strategic combination is necessary to combat the rising
threats with asymmetric costs, such as shooting down drone swarms, spy
balloons, and dumb rockets without wasting $1M per shot on a sophisticated
missile.*

Hello!

For Christina, Matt is a senior at Harvard in Prod, a Pear Fellow, and is
very passionate about early stage venture investing.

For Matt, Christina is an investor at FPV and has been extremely supportive
of Prod. Given your background/interests, figured y'all would benefit from
speaking.

Hope you two can find time to chat!

Best,
Arul

Hi Nabeel and Natalie,

Hope you=E2=80=99re doing well! Really appreciate you both taking the time =
to meet
last week and am currently thinking through what we discussed. On a
separate note, one of our Prod teams, Etched AI, got a few term sheets and
are opening up their round. Thought y=E2=80=99all may be a good fit, let me=
 know if
you=E2=80=99d like an intro:

*Gavin and Chris are working on Etched AI. They=E2=80=99re building an ASIC=
-based
solution that can speed up the performance of Large Language Models by more
than 100x. They have a strong technical design and are getting ready to
bring it to production.*

Best,
Arul

Arul

Hi Vince,

Checking with our international founders to make sure they are free then.

Hi Vince,

15-20min individual consultations may work best if that=E2=80=99s possible.=
 Let me

cohort members. Thanks so much!

Thanks for the intro David. (to bcc)

Great to e-meet you Vince! We have several teams in our program that are on
student visas and are unsure how to remain in the US if they choose to
continue working on their companies full-time. It would be great if someone
on the Clark Lau team could speak to them to advise on best practices. Let
me know if this is a possibility. Thanks so much!

Best,

Thanks so much for the intro Thomas (to bcc)!

Great to meet you Wells and Cody! Apologies for the delay in response, I
was out of the country the past week and a half and just got back. Would
love to discuss best ways to work together; we have several international
founders that have been wrestling with their options for the past few
months. Do you have time Wednesday before 1:30pm ET, Thursday between
4:30pm-6:30pm ET or Friday after 11:30am ET? Thanks so much and
looking forward to connecting soon!

Best,

Hey Bel=C3=A9n, would love to chat this week. Great to meet you as well
Catherine! Some relevant updates on our end:

We=E2=80=99ve finalized details for our hacker house this year in S=C3=A3o =
Paulo,
Brazil. We=E2=80=99ll be there from Jan 2nd to 21st and have 30 rockstar
Harvard/MIT teams from the cohort joining us.

The first weekend of the trip (Jan 6-8), we=E2=80=99re thinking of doing a
hackathon to jumpstart the teams=E2=80=99 progress and help set them on the=
 right
trajectory for the rest of the trip. Ideally, we=E2=80=99d like to surprise=
 the
teams and tell them that some big names are coming Sunday to see what
they=E2=80=99re up to - we=E2=80=99ve talked with Jared Friedman from YC ab=

Michael Seibel about coming on the trip and we=E2=80=99re seeing if this ti=

would work for them as well. Could be great to co-run this event with
Thrive and invite some later stage founders/Josh if available as guest

Thrive and make this a unique chance for y=E2=80=99all to meet the teams wh=

they=E2=80=99re fully focused on building without school.

Let me know when works this week to chat  - the hackathon could be an
awesome way to kick off working together. Thanks so much!

Hello!

For Ben, Gavin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/guberti/> and Chris
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/czhu1729/> are Harvard students in Prod
working on speeding up LLM performance through ASICs and have had some
exciting technical progress. They=E2=80=99ve gotten a couple of term sheets=
 and are
thinking of opening up their round.

For Gavin and Chris, Ben <https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencmejla/> is an
investor at TheGP and previously helped run Dorm Room Fund when he was at
First Round Capital. Figured y'all would benefit from chatting.

Hope you find time to connect!

Thanks so much for the intro Federico (to bcc to spare your inbox).

Great to virtually meet you Shail! Would love to tell you a bit more about
Prod and how we can potentially work together. Let me know if you have any
time next week. Thanks so much!

Best,
Arul

Hello!

AZ, Billy and Miles are freshmen (crazy I know) at Harvard building a CRM
data integration company called MergeLink. They've been moving super fast
on product and have some exciting early customer relationships.

For Billy and Miles, AZ <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariellezuckerberg/> is
a GP at Long Journey Ventures and has an insane investing track record. AZ
has been super helpful in supporting Prod this year and figured you all
would benefit from meeting.

Hope you find time to connect!

Best,
Arul

Hi Federico,

It was great meeting you today! I have posted the Segment Perk in our
slack and am excited to be working together! As discussed, below is a short
blurb about Prod Sponsorship, along with a notion doc:

Prod <https://www.prod.so/> is a 501(c)3 *Harvard/MIT* startup accelerator
redefining the earliest stages of entrepreneurship. Last year our first
cohort of *12 teams raised* *>$25M at a $240M cap* and had 5 teams get into
YCombinator. This year *Cohort 2.0 of 38 teams *are already moving faster
than last year's teams. We are looking for sponsors who share our vision
for young entrepreneurship to cover lodging costs with our annual
hacker-house over January. More details here
<https://sprinkle-eustoma-9dd.notion.site/Prod-Partnership-32a32e8866594278=
b7635826e131092d>
-
reach out to arulkapoor@college.harvard.edu if interested!

Thanks so much!

Best,
Arul

Hi Federico,

Great to virtually meet you! I just filled out the airtable form - would
love to discuss how Prod can work more closely with Segment if you have 15
min this week. Thanks so much!

Hey guys,

Spoke to each of you briefly past couple of days, but figured y'all would
benefit from a formal connection.

For Raph, Michael is working on cursor.so which is an AI enabled IDE.
They're looking for some great engineers to test their product and are
looking to hire.

For Michael, Raph is in the second cohort and has a ton of full-stack
experience and a former YC founder. He's working on some cool gen AI stuff,
so thought you guys may enjoy jamming together.

Hope you find time to chat!

Best,
Arul

Hi Zane,

It was great meeting you last week! I have attached a one-pager on Prod her=
e
<https://sprinkle-eustoma-9dd.notion.site/Prod-Sponsors-6c04134653fc469c809=
6bd6c77fd63b0>.
Let me know if you and Balaji are interested in hearing more about how to
support the program. Right now, our biggest priority is fundraising for our
winter hacker-house. We have raised enough to cover lodging expenses, but
are ~$19.5k short to provide financial aid to Prod cohort members who can't
cover airfare and are on nearly full financial aid from their universities.
We think our vision for Prod aligns well with the Network State values and
would love to keep in touch to hear your thoughts on how best to grow.
Thanks so much!

Best,
Arul

Hi Liz and Jeff,

Hope you had great Thanksgivings! Wanted to follow up on our discussion
last week on Prod sponsorship. We think a16z makes a lot of sense as a
partner for Prod and would love to move forward if you=E2=80=99re equally
interested. Let us know if you have some time this week to discuss further.

Best,
Arul

Hi Arielle,

Thank you so much for your work on this! I think this could be extremely
valuable to some of our teams. Let me know if I should reach out to
Federico directly for next steps. Thanks again!

Thanks so much for sending over these decks! Planning to do more research
and will get back with any interesting findings in the coming weeks (I'll
also follow up with a blurb to forward to Jay).

Also wanted to ask if you had a chance to discuss Prod sponsorship. We've
had some firms express interest in co-leading the trip as the sole VC
sponsor, but wanted to check-in as we think BoxGroup uniquely aligns with
our approach to young entrepreneurship. If you're interested in moving
forward, would love to discuss more details tomorrow/early next week.
Thanks so much!

Best,
Arul

Hi Claire and Adina,

It was great hearing more about how you are seeing the software for
hardware space! As discussed, I have outlined some information on Prod's
Cohort 1.0 and Hackerhouse sponsorship below. For background, Cohort 2.0 is
almost twice the size of Cohort 1.0 and is already moving even faster than
last year. Excited to hear your and the team's thoughts!

*Tiers*:

   - Bronze (3K) - Covers the cost of one student in Prod. Comes with
   invite to closed demo day + branding
   - Silver (8K) - Covers the cost of one team in Prod. Comes with bronze +
   team updates, intros, ability to hold an office hours
   - Gold (20K) -  Covers the cost of several teams in Prod. Comes with
   silver + co-led workshop
   - Platinum - bespoke partnership, such as co-led hacker house,
   exclusivity, or more

*Talent Snippets:*

   - Arvid won a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad
   - Jonas is one of several YC alumni in the cohort, after working at
   Palantir and a VC
   - Karen rebuilt the enterprise sales team at a $4 billion B2B fintech
   unicorn
   - Josh co-taught the hardest graduate AI course at MIT=E2=80=A6 at age 2=
1

*Cohort 1 Team Snippets:*

   - Empiric Network raised $7M and launched their platform with
   partnerships from Jane Street, FTX, and more
   - Remnote recently released a brand new product and hit 400,000 users
   - Tutor Intelligence expanded their team to 15, and had their first
   deployment this year
   - Distributed Spectrum protects facilities by detecting radio signals
   efficiently and hit >$500K revenue during the cohort


Given we are a 501(c)3, ensuring the trip goes smoothly is our top
priority. We really want to find a way to work with BoxGroup given our
mission alignment (and already organic overlap!) - let me know how you
think we can make something happen. Thanks so much!

Best,
Arul

Hi Zane,

A week from today works as well! If you have some time this week that would
be great, as our final exam period begins next week, but no worries if not.
Thanks so much and looking forward to speaking soon!

Arul

Thanks for the intro Ben! (to bcc)

Hi Ali,

Hope you are doing well! Would love to chat sometime to update you on
Cohort 2.0 and discuss how Neo and Prod could continue to collaborate. Let
me know when works best for you. Thanks so much, and I am looking forward
to speaking soon!

Hello!

AZ, Luke, Wes, and Richter are MIT students building Kino, an AI enabled
video editor. They built an impressive MVP over our Brazil hacker house and
have a ton of demand from professional video editors, hobbyists, and
everything in between.

For Luke, Wes, and Richter, AZ
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariellezuckerberg/> is a GP at Long Journey
Ventures and has an insane investing track record. AZ has been super
helpful in supporting Prod this year and figured you all would benefit from
meeting.

Hope you find time to connect!

Best,
Arul

Hello!

Kanyi, Ethan
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-thornton-74417024a/?trk=org-employees>
is an MIT dropout working on a super cool defense tech startup who we've
been working with through Prod. He's thinking about raising a round in the
next few weeks so figured you may be interested in meeting.

For Ethan, Kanyi <https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanyi/> is the Managing
Partner at Kindred and helped give some advice to Prod as we were
navigating our own nonprofit sponsorship raise!

Hope you find time to chat!

Hey Walden,

Wanted to introduce you to Prod's resident self-hating VC, Richard Dahan.
Richard is an MIT alum and has made it his mission to train the next
generation of unicorn founders. He's also helping us plan our demo day and
figured you'd benefit from talking with him.

For Richard, Walden is a sophomore at Harvard who is working on automated
smart contract auditing tools. (He also is friends with many Prodlings!).

Hope you find time to chat!

Best,
Arul

Hi Max,

Great to meet you as well! I could do 3:30 on Monday or Wednesday, or
anytime before 4 on Friday. I have not been to playa bowls but I've heard
good things if you're down. And yes I am in Stat 212 haha!

Dear Micaela,

Hope you are doing well! I wanted to thank you for setting up my round 2
interview. I really enjoyed speaking with Leeraz and going through the case
study. Would it be possible for you to send me her email so I can thank her
as well?

Thanks again for all your help and hope you have a wonderful rest of the
week!

Best,
Arul

Hi Micaela,

Thanks so much for setting these up!

I just wanted to clarify the time for the round 2 interview. You mentioned
it would be 10am PT, but I think the invite is for 1pm PT. Please let me
know which time I should plan for. I am really excited about meeting Erik
and Leeraz.

Thanks again for your help! Have a great evening!

Best,
Arul

Hi Micaela,


Hope you are doing well! I just thought I would follow up to see if the
time windows I had sent to you yesterday are convenient for scheduling the
demo and my round 2 interview.


Please let me know if you would like me to send any additional times. I
truly appreciate your help in scheduling the interviews.


Thanks so much and have a great rest of the day!


Best,

Arul

Hi Micaela,


It was great speaking with you this afternoon! I really enjoyed hearing
about your journey to Alpine and especially the commitment and mentorship
provided by senior members for new hires.


I wanted to follow up on our conversation at the end of the interview
regarding scheduling the next rounds. If possible, I would really
appreciate it if we could schedule my round 2 interview for early next
week. I have moved my travel plans towards that end so that I can do the
case study round before leaving on my trip. Additionally, as we discussed,
I would love to go through the case study demo sometime this week to get
familiarized with the question format.


Please let me know if this would be feasible when you get a chance. Thanks
so much for all your help!


Best,

Arul

Hi Micaela,

I actually have a Math final that just got scheduled during that window,
would it be possible to speak anytime on Monday or Tuesday? Really sorry
about this, the exam window has been up in the air since it's all online.
Thanks so much!
