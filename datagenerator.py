Hello!

For Nabeel, Gavin and Chris are Harvard students in Prod working on speeding up LLM performance through ASICs and have had some exciting technical progress. Theyâ€™ve gotten a couple of term sheets and are thinking of opening up their round.

For Gavin and Chris, Nabeel is a GP at Spark and has an insane investing track record. Nabeel has been super helpful in supporting Prod this year and figured you all would benefit from meeting.

Hope you find time to connect!

Best,
